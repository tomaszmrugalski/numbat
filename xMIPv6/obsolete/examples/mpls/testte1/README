This is a sample to demonstrate CSPF algorithm used in RSVP-TE.
The network consists of 5 LSR and 4 hosts. Host 1 and 2 have different requests
of bandwidth level.

Depending on the availability of the network topology, the CSPF will find a route
appropriate for each of the requests. The criteria is first based on Bandwidth
available and secondly the delay.
