LSP preemption example.

The network consists of 5 LSRs and 4 hosts. The LSP between host1
and host3 is established before host2 starts sending packets.
As host2 starts sending packets, new LSP setup competes on resources with
the old LSP (host1-host3). Since the new LSP's setup priority is higher
than the old LSP's holding priority, the old LSP is preempted by the new one.
