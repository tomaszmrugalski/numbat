An example of Explicit Routing in RSVP-TE.

The network consists of 5 LSRs and 2 hosts. Host2 establishes its path
based on the input of ROUTE specified by the administrator from an
input file called traffic.xml.

The format of input ROUTE is:
<route>firstAddress, LBit, secondAddress, LBit, ...</route>

LBit is 1 if the nexthop is loose hop and 0 if strict.


<traffic>

<conn>
  <src>11.0.0.1</src>
  <dest>11.0.1.2</dest>
  <setupPri>7</setupPri>
  <holdingPri>7</holdingPri>
  <bandwidth>0</bandwidth>
  <delay>0</delay>
  <ER>true</ER>
  <route>1.0.0.1,0, 1.0.0.3,0, 1.0.0.4,0, 1.0.0.5,0, 10.0.1.2,0</route>
</conn>

</traffic>
