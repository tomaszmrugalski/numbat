	* tcpmodule.cc: checked in patch from Joung Woong Lee [zipizigi1@hotmail.com]:
	- bugfix: with delayed ack feature, an ack advanced the window by only
	  1 segment even if ack acknowledged several ones.
	- added "mss" (maximum segment size) module parameter -- before it was
	  536 hardcoded
        - added "cOutVector *rec_seq_no" for check receiver(client)'s data
          reception state

	* tcpmodule.cc: simplifications, more informative debug output
	- deleted all setPhase() lines -- they aren't informative since
	  TCPModule services multiple connections;
	- getTcb(): added debug output;
	- simplification: AddPor eliminated (replaced by SockPair)
	- simplification: TcpTcb.tb_state eliminated (state was stored in
	  the FSM, and tb_state was never used except in ev<<'s)
	- status() renamed to printStatus(), order of fields made more logical
	  (state and src/dest addr/port were brought forward), print name
	  of state and event type instead of numeric value
	- there were two enums for TCP state, thrown out one (LISTEN, SYN_RCVD,
	  etc.) and kept the TCP_S_xxx ones.

	* tcpmodule.cc: compile fix for GCC 3.1

2001-11-02  Rolf Kussaether <ufeq@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc : Fast Recovery (Reno-TCP), New-Reno-TCP

2001-09-05  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.ned: reactivated parameter TCPDelayedAck

	* tcpmodule.cc (segReceive): conditional ackSchedule() depending
	on _feature_delayed_ack introduced by Verena
	(handleMessage): placed setPhase() statements into FSM_Enter cases
	of FSM_Switch() macro
	(handleMessage): new local variable bool delete_tcb to signal the
	deletion of the tcb_block. This is to avoid a bug of reading
	already freed memory.

2001-08-31  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.ned: commented out parameters TCPSlowStart and
	TCPDelayedAck since they aren't used so far.

2000-12-19  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* TCP-Model merged into ip-suite. From now on, you will find the
	TCP test environment in ../Networks/TCPTester

2000-12-01  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* omnetpp.ini: parameter debug set for server and client

	* tcp2.ned: new parameter "debug" in Server and Client declaration

	* procserver/applserver/applclient.cc: produce verbose output if debug==true only

	* applserver/applclient.ned: new parameter debug

	* procserver.cc (activity): removed timeout when waiting for TCP_I_RCVD_SYN

	* applserver.cc (activity): removed timeout

2000-11-30  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* applclient.cc (activity): handle TCP_I_CLOSED correctly when
	waiting for TCP_I_ESTAB

	* tcpmodule.cc: some additional defines for timeouts

	* omnetpp.ini : raised timout to 5 minutes (RFC 793)

	* procserver.cc (activity): More verbosity added to receive
	handling. Placed return statement at end of CLOSE_WAIT processing.

	* applserver.cc (passiveOpen): removed appl_timeout from parameter list.

	* applclient.cc (activity): More verbosity added to receive() handling.

	* applserver.cc (activity): More verbosity added to receive() handling.


2000-11-29  Verena Kahmann  <kahmann@holmes.telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc (ackSchedule): function called now with boolean
	immediate to reflect scheduling of immediate ack (immediate == true)
	or delayed ack (immediate == false). In latter case, the delayed
	ack timer is scheduled. Cases when immediate ack needed TBD.

2000-11-28  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc (tcpArrivalMsg): Code changed according to
	AddPor::source and restructured for better readability
	(anaEvent): code restructured due to AddPor::source. Use of case
	statements instead of if/else where appropriate.
	(handleMessage): calls to anaEvent() changed due to
	AddPor::source.
	(handleMessage): renamed amsg to msg and amsg_tcp_header to
	msg_tcp_header. Renamed msg that was created in this function to
	rst_msg.
	(handleMessage): msg now gets deleted at end of
	handleMessage(). This is the only "good" place to do that.
	Therefore delete statements in subroutines were removed.

	* tcp.h (struct AddPor): replaced 'bool fromappl" with new Enum
	'MsgSource source' which describes the origin of received messages
	more precisely (elements are: FROM_APPL, FROM_IP, FROM_TIMEOUT).

2000-11-27  Verena Kahmann  <kahmann@quincy.telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc (handleMessage): BugFix: initialize and reset of
	bool finwait2_sch to show scheduling of FIN_WAIT_2 Timer.

2000-11-27  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* procserver.cc (activity): code restructuring regarding the
	processing of received messages. If/Else clauses are now put into
	correct order (check if msg is NULL before accessing member
	functions). Procserver output is more verbose now. With its GOTO
	statements, the code is still ugly and needs more work if it
	should serve as an example implementation.

2000-11-26  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* procserver.cc (activity): Bugfix on receive(): checking if
	msg==NULL before accessing member functions of msg. This catches
	the case where an appl_timeout occures and receive() returns
	without a msg. However, there is no correct handling of
	this case so far.

2000-11-21  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc (copyQueues): BugFix: added real dupping of
	fqdata_packet when (fqdata_packet_len_octets <
	number_of_octets_to_copy)

2000-10-17  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcp2.ned: Two network definitions now: tcpip and tcptest

	* omnetpp.ini: selection of networks now in section [General]

	* Simple module declarations that were collected in file tcp2.ned
	now put into separate files each: applclient.ned, comnw.ned,
	procserver.ned, tcptester.ned, applserver.ned, ipmodule.ned,
	switch.ned, tcpmodule.ned


2000-10-05  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc (segReceive): 'delete pseg_rec' removed because it is
	now deleted in the outer frame by removeListElement().
	(retransQueueProcess): test for equality is == not = !! in C/C++
	Corrected the faulty conditional clauses.

2000-09-29  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc : simple switch-mechanism to enable selection of
	different TCP features. Added feature _feature_fast_rt (Fast
	Retransmission).

	* Code indendation and spell checking of comments and strings

	* Introduction of Comment Tags:
	FIXME: UNTESTED   Code/Function has not been tested so far
	FIXME: MBI        Code/Function might be incorrect
	These Tags should be used to mark the "code status" or to point out
	obvious oddities


2000-09-29  Verena Kahmann <kahmann@telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tcpmodule.cc : Karn's Algorithm, Retransmission Timer, Slow
	Start, Congestion Avoidance


2000-04-11  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* README: new file to store credits, etc. :-)
	* Added GPL headers to all files
