TCP
===

This folder contains the "base part" of TCP, basically the operation
described in RFC793. This base algorithm can be extended and customized via
"flavour" and "queue" classes that implement the TCPAlgorith, TCPSendQueue
and TCPReceiveQueue classes, and are selected via TCP's NED parameters.
This implementation supports RFCs: 793, 1122, 2018, 2581, 2883, 3042, 3390, 3517, 3782.
The old version of TCP is deprecated and can be found in the tcp_old directory under
the tcp_old namespace.

The main class is TCP, which manages a set of TCPConnections. A TCP segment
is instance of the TCPSegment class. The TCP simple module must implement the ITCP
module interface allowing to exchange the implementation of TCP in other modules
for example in StandardHost. Check the StandardHost module and the tcpType parameter
to configure the TCP implementation in a host. It is possible to use TCP_old in some
modules while using TCP for others in the same simulation.
