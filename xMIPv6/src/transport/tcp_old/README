TCP_old
=======
(deprecated)

This directory contains an older, deprecated version of TCP called TCP_old
(implementing RFC793), which does not support SACK and other features.
This base algorithm can be extended and customized via "flavour" and "queue"
classes that implement the TCPAlgorith, TCPSendQueue and TCPReceiveQueue
classes, and are selected via TCP's NED parameters.

The main class is tcp_old::TCP. To avoid name collisions the old version has
been placed into the tcp_old namespace. You should specify the namespace prefix
also if you are configuring the queue and flavour parameters.

Note that it is possible to use different TCP implementations at the same time
in a simulation, for example you can have some hosts in your simulation
with TCP_old and others witch with TCP modules. Use the tcpType parameter
in StandardHost to change the TCP implementation.
