 Numbat Changelog
------------------

2011-10-08
- imported xMIPv6 framework, patch by Adam Jastrzebski
- rewritten documentation (now using doxygen)

2011-09-20
- xMIPv6 integrated with Numbat, by Adam Jastrzebski

2010-04-11
- OMNeT++ 4.0 compilation fixed under Windows and Linux.

2009-09-29
- Migration to OMNeT++ 4.0 by Mikko Majanen, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland
- Fixed one bug that happened when BS sent two different kind of RNG-RSP messages
  (anonymous ho RNG-RSP and normal RNG-RSP) in the same frame --> SS received the 
  wrong one and started messing up with CIDs, i.e. sent SBC-REQ with CID=0. This 
  bug happened also sometimes in the original v3. (MiM)

2009-04-07
- Experimental support for Windows version added (Visual Studio .NET 2003)

2009-01-18
- DHCPv6, RA messages are now derived from IPv6 messages
- Convergence Sublayer in WiMax written for real

2009-01-15
- start updating changelog again :)
- Here's the status as of today:
- WiMax
    * based on IEEE 802.16-2005 (aka 802.16e)
    * Simple radio/PHY layer - unicast (SS to BS) and multicast (BS to SS) transmissions
    * OFDMA transmission (including CDMA codes, radio frame slots/symbols)
    * Bandwidth management: BWR, CDMA codes for ranging and BWR transmission)
    * Supported traffic classes: Best Effort (BE) and Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS)
    * Control plane: Network entry(RNG-REQ, RNG-RSP, SBC-REQ, SBC-RSP, PKM-REQ, PKM-RSP, REG-REQ, REG-RSP messages)
    * Control plane: Service flow creation/mgmt (DSA-REQ, DSA-RSP, DSA-ACK)
    * Control plane: Scanning (SCN-REQ, SCN-RSP)
    * Control plane: Handover (BSHO-REQ, MSHO-RSP, HO-IND)
    * Several traffic models: fixed, handover after timeout, distance based handover
    * Simple event signalling, so you don't have to understand whole stack operation to 
      get some notification (similar to MIH 802.21-style events, but easier)
    * Several optimization allowed by 802.16-2005 standard are configurable
    * multiple SSes support (optimizations can be enabled on a per SS basis)
    * Connection management and queuing
    * multiple BSes support
    * Handover between BSes
- IPv6
    * IPv6Node: traffic source/sink, with statistics and various traffic generation models
    * RAGen/RArcv: Router Advertisement generator and receiver, used to configure IPv6 nodes in stateless mode
    * DHCPv6 client: several proposed enhancements supported
    * DHCPv6 server: Supports relays and several extra enhancements
    * MobileIPv6 Mobile Node: Simple implementation of the MN
    * MobileIPv6 Home Agent
    * IPv6 dispatcher, that inteligently redirects packets to specific modules. It is also mobility aware.

2006-12-28
- it is possible to connect multiple nodes to one SS or BS
- connections are createad automatically (one connection
  for each module connected to WMaxMacBS/SS.
- Skeleton WMax Control Plane added (WMaxCtrlSS/BS).

2006-12-27
- IPv6 nodes traffic model is now configurable
- partial support for multiple connections (ssPHY, bsPHY)
- control info (WMaxMacHeader) added to messages

2006-12-11
- uplink and downlink is now operational!

some-time-ago
- added ipv6node module and 2 instances: ssIPv6 and bsIPv6.
- fixed problem with frames all starting at 0.005 ms.
