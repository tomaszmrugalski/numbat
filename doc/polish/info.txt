This directory contains additional files that are in Polish. As Numbat is being developed
primarily at Gdansk University of Technology, many students involved are Poles. Some of
them wrote documents that are in Polish. Those documents will be eventuall translated to
English and most probably included into Numbat Developer's Guide. Unfortunately, there
is nobody who is willing to take this task at this time.
