Numbat with Akaroa integration
by Aniela Mrugalska

Installation instructions for Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 64bit

Akaroa 2.7.11
=============

Downloaded from: http://www.akaroa.canterbury.ac.nz/doWnlOAd.chtml

tar zxvf akaroa-2.7.11.tar.gz

Apply patches 1 and 2:

cd akaroa-2.7.11
./configure
make

# This step generates PDF documentation
cd src/doc
make
ps2pdf manual.ps

sudo make install
export PATH=/usr/local/akaroa/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/akaroa/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

After those steps are completed, it is possible to run akaroa:
akmaster (in first console)
akslave (in second console)

This step is optional
akgui (in third console)

OMNeT++ 4.2.2
=============

Software needed for integration:
OMNeT++ 4.2.2, downloaded from www.omnetpp.org

Install prerequisites from Ubuntu packages:
tck8.5 tck8.5-dev tk8.5 tk8.5-dev and others

tar zxvf omnetpp-4.2.2-src.tgz
cd omnetpp-4.2.2
. setenv
export TCL_LIBRARY=/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.5
export PATH=/home/aniela/devel/omnetpp-4.2.2/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/aniela/devel/omnetpp-4.2.2/lib

./configure
make

To start omnet, type omnetpp

Numbat
======

There are at least 2 numbat versions:

a) original version: http://klub.com.pl/numbat/

b) version with better QoS:
https://github.com/urban-1/numbat.git

Version a) was used.

Compilation is described in Numbat User's Guide:
http://klub.com.pl/numbat/doxygen/index.html
then click Installation and usage

Import project into namespace...
Right click numbat->xMIPv6/src/linklayer/ext ->
-> properties... -> Exclude resource from build

Project-> Build all

Running Numbat under Akaroa
===========================

Select numbat-git in Project Explorer
Run -> Run -> OMNeT++ Simulation

Edit numbat-akaroa.ini to select which vector (or vectors) should
be exported to Akaroa. Make sure that you export only small number
of parameters (preferably just 1). Otherwise your simulation will take
a very long time to complete. Here is an example:

# Let's specify which output vectors should be under Akaroa control
# To get a full list of available vector names, see akaroa.vec file
physim.BS[0].bsMac.WMaxMACqueue.with-akaroa = true

Select init and config:
numbat-akaroa.ini

Click run, then express run to see that the simulation is
working properly. Simulation should stop eventuall with parameters
similar to this one:

Param    Estimate       Delta  Conf         Var   Count   Trans
    1     1.03818   0.0337501  0.95 0.000203607    4950     550

This gui run is awkward to use and do not allow to specify any
Akaroa parameters. It is much better to run it from command-line:

akrun -n 1 ./numbat-git numbat-akaroa.ini

Additional parameters may be specified:
akrun -n 1 -D Confidence=0.90 ./numbat-git numbat-akaroa.ini

Note that achieving Confidence level 0.98 takes much longer than 0.90.
akrun -n 1 -D Confidence=0.98 ./numbat-git numbat-akaroa.ini

Misc notes
==========

See Chapter 4 from Akaroa 2.8 User's Manual (src/doc/manual.ps
in akaroa sources) for details. It is also possible to create
Akaroa file that contains specified parameters.

akgui may be used to monitor simulation run (graphical).

akstats -L may be used to monitor simulation run (text).

omnetpp-4.2.2/src/envir/akoutvectormgr.cc is a class that is
responsible for exporting data from Numbat (or any other OMNeT++
simulation) to Akaroa. registerVector() method is called for
each vector once. record() is called every time a new data is
recorded in vector, even in vectors that are not sent to Akaroa.

It is useful to export data to *.vec file (akaroa.vec by default).
It contains all recorded values for all vectors. Those vectors
can be plotted using OMNeT++ IDE.
